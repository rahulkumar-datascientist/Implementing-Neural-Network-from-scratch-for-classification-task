# Implementing-Neural-Network-from-scratch-for-classification-task
This project aims to learn and improve the understanding of Deep Neural Nets. How they work internally and how the training is carried out. The neural net is implemented using only numpy operations - so that every step is visible and help in understanding the internal concept.
